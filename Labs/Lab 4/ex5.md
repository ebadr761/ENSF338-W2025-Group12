When measuring execution time, system noise such as CPU fluctuations, garbage collection, and background processes can affect accuracy. timeit.timeit() runs the function multiple times and returns a single total execution time, making it good for stable benchmarks where execution time is consistent but it may not account for system performance variations. However timeit.repeat() runs the function multiple times across multiple rounds, providing a list of execution times, which helps detect fluctuations and outliers. This makes timeit.repeat() better for noisy environments where execution time varies. Use timeit.timeit() for quick, stable benchmarks and timeit.repeat() for more accurate performance analysis when variability is a concern.

For timeit.timeit(), the best statistic to use is the average because it returns a single total execution time for multiple iterations, and dividing by the number of runs gives a meaningful per-execution time. For timeit.repeat(), the min time is most appropriate as it reflects the best-case performance, minimizing the impact of system noise like CPU fluctuations or background processes. The max time is useful for identifying worst-case slowdowns, while the average provides a general trend but may be skewed by outliers. So for the average its better to use timeit.timeit(), and for the min or max its better to use timeit.repeat() depending on whether you are interested in best-case or worst-case performance.
