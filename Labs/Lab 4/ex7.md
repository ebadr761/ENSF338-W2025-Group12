# Time Complexity and Optimization of reverse() Function

## 1. Time Complexity Expression

### **Understanding the Implementation**

The given reverse() function follows these steps:

1. Initializes newhead and prevNode as None.
2. Iterates from the last element of the linked list to the first using range(self.get_size()-1, -1, -1). This loop runs **O(n)** times.
3. In each iteration:
   - Calls self.get_element_at_pos(i), which traverses the linked list from the head to the i-th node. This operation is **O(n)** in the worst case.
   - Creates a new node currNewNode and adjusts pointers.
4. Finally, updates self.head to newhead.

### **Step-by-Step Complexity Calculation**

- The loop runs **n** times.
- Each iteration calls get_element_at_pos(i), which **takes O(n) time**.
- The total complexity is:

  O(n) x O(n) = O(n²)

### **Conclusion**

The current implementation has **O(n²) time complexity** due to repeated calls to get_element_at_pos(i). This is very inefficient and can be improved by iterating over the list only once.



## 2. Optimized Implementation

### **Optimized Approach**

Instead of repeatedly calling get_element_at_pos(i), we'll traverse the list once while reversing pointers. This reduces the time complexity to **O(n)**.

### **Optimized Code**

```python
class LinkedList:
    def reverse(self):
        prevNode = None
        currNode = self.head
        
        while currNode:
            next = currNode.next  # Store next node
            currNode.next = prevNode  # Reverse the pointer
            prevNode = currNode  # Move prevNode one step forward
            currNode = next  # Move currNode one step forward
        
        self.head = prevNode  # Update head to the new first node
```

### **Changes**

1. **Single traversal**: Instead of iterating n times and calling get_element_at_pos(i), we iterate once.
2. **In-place reversal**: We reverse the next pointers without extra space.
3. **Efficient updates**: We maintain prevNode, currNode, and next to efficiently swap pointers.

### **Time Complexity Comparison**

| Implementation        | Time Complexity |
| --------------------- | --------------- |
| Original reverse()  | O(n²)           |
| Optimized reverse() | O(n)            |

### **Conclusion**

The optimized solution improves performance from **O(n²) to O(n)** by removing unnecessary linked list traversals. This makes it significantly more efficient for large linked lists.
